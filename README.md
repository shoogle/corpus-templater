=======================

Create template scores for OpenScore Lieder Corpus

Try it in a browser at <https://shoogle.github.io/lieder-corpus-templater/>.

If running locally, you need to relax some browser security settings to enable
the local script to talk to a remote server:

- __Firefox:__ Go to "about:config" and set `privacy.file_unique_origin` to `false`.

Don't forget to re-enable the security setting once you are done.
